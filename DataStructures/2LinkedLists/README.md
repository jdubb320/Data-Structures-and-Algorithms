# Linked Lists

A linked list is a sequence of nodes that have a pointer to the next node and the previous node. This is not a constant lookup but you can add/remove items from the beginning in constant time.

Singly linked list: nodes only point to next node
Doubly linked list: nodes point to next and previous node
