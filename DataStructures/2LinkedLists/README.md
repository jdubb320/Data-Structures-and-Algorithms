# Linked Lists

A linked list is a sequence of nodes that have a pointer to the next node and the previous node. This is not a constant lookup but you can add/remove items from the beginning in constant time.

_Singly linked list_: nodes only point to next node

_Doubly linked list_: nodes point to next and previous node
