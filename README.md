# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This repository is to help me re-learn different data structures, algorithms, and concepts in Computer Science.

| Data Structures | Algorithms | Concepts |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Linked Lists | Breadth-First Search | Bit Manipulation |
| Trees, Tries, & Graphs | Depth-First Search | Memory (Stack v. Heap) |
| Stacks & Queues | Binary Search | Recursion |
| Heaps | Merge Sort | Dynamic Programming |
| Vectors/ArrayLists | Quick Sort | Big O Time & Space |
| Hash Tables | | |
